Why am I awake?
Nails on the floor
And soot on my tongue
I don't know his name
But I still taste the rum
Nothing there but skin
Skeletons crawl on the ceiling
They know
That him and his aftershave hit like a drug (drug, drug)
Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us
Now you're fading
And I wonder who will erase me
Who will erase me?
Race you to the end
My innocence waits like it desperately knows
That I'll crash if I don't let you go (go)
Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us (in and out of wanting us)
Now you're fading (fading)
And I wonder who will erase me
Erase me
Erase me
And I wonder who will erase me
Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us
Now you're fading
And I wonder who will erase
Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading (fading)
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us (in and out of wanting us)
Now you're fading (fading)
And I wonder who will erase me
Oh, who will erase me?
